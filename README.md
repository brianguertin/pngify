pngify
======

Script to quickly convert PDF images to Android PNG resources.

On the command line specify the PDF files and/or directories (that contain PDF files) 
and the script will generate PNG images at mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, and xxhdpi in the current working directory.

If you want xxxhdpi assets, just add a "4" to the list of scalevalues in the script
